***************
Lesson

Make a web page to track your expenses. To start off with, just make a form where users can input a description and amount for each purchase, and list out all the purchases.

Make a prototype called Purchase to create objects for the purchases. It's always a good idea to pick out names for prototypes that closely match the real-world language we use to talk about them.

An expense tracker isn't very useful if you can't categorize your purchases. Make a form where users can create new categories. When users picks a category, it lists all the purchases in the category, and has a place to add new purchases.
